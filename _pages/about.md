Hi! My name is Sean. I research how to help language models reason better, and teach students to help them do the same.

Brief History
======
I started studying computer science at UC Berkeley in 2018. I was hooked and after my first year started teaching -- local high schoolers through [CSEdweek](https://www.csedweek.org/), classmates as an [academic intern](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp19/academic-interns.html), local high-schoolers as a [UTK volunteer in Lima](https://utk.berkeley.edu/#about-us) and after my first year as an [Undergraduate Student Instructor](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su19/TAs.html) for our intro CS class. I kept teaching as a TA -- the 
[intro class](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su19/),
[machine learning class](https://www.eecs189.org/),
[discrete math and probability theory](https://www.su20.eecs70.org/) -- for 7 more semesters.

I started AI research with [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/), studying the emergent ability of language models to detect strategy in chess games.


Now I'm currently a first-year PhD student with [Professor Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) at [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/).
