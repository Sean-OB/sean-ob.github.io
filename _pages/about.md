Hi! My name is Sean. I research how to help language models reason better, and teach students to help them do the same.

Brief History
======
I started at UC Berkeley in 2018, studying applied math, cognitive science, electrical engineering and computer science.
My first year, I got hooked on teaching -- local high schoolers through [CSEdweek](https://www.csedweek.org/), classmates as an [academic intern](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp19/academic-interns.html), local high-schoolers as a [UTK volunteer in Lima](https://utk.berkeley.edu/#about-us) and after my first year as an [Undergraduate Student Instructor](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su19/TAs.html) for our intro CS class. I kept teaching as a TA -- the courses for
[introductory programming](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su19/),
[machine learning](https://www.eecs189.org/),
[discrete math and probability theory](https://www.su20.eecs70.org/) -- for 7 more semesters.

As I gained experience teaching, I also started my first foray into research -- specifically, astrophysics. I was lucky to be mentored by [Professor Karl van Bibber](https://nuc.berkeley.edu/people/karl-van-bibber/) as we set out on a new search for dark matter. Exploiting the Doppler shift, physical simulations and some very noisy telescope data, our team pioneered a [new dark matter search](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2156/1/012026/meta) that was accepted into The Astrophysical Journal.

In my last undergraduate year, I began my first dip into AI research with Professor [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/), studying the emergent ability of language models to detect strategy in chess games. We built a semantic chess search engine and chronicled the ways in which language models can fail to keep track of board states.

Now I'm currently a first-year PhD student at UC San Diego, fortunate to be advised by [Professor Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).
